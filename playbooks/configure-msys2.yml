# NOTE: This playbook requires Ansible to be run locally on a Windows machine. 
# To use Ansible on Windows, the easiest way is to have MSYS2 already installed (so this is a chicken and egg scenario, sorry!). 
# Therefore, before running this playbook, you either need to manually install MSYS2 and Ansible, or, run a pre-installation script. 
# 
# If you want to do this manually, here are the steps:
# a) Install Chocolatey by running the following command in PowerShell as an administrator:
#    # SEE: https://chocolatey.org/install
#    Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force;
#    [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072;
#    iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
# b) Install MSYS2 using Chocolatey by running the following command in PowerShell as an administrator:
#    choco install msys2
# c) Open MSYS2 terminal and install Ansible by running the following commands:
#    pacman -Syu
#    pacman -S ansible
# d) Run this playbook in MSYS2 to ensure everything is set up correctly and configured.
#    You may have to locate the executable. Depending upon the method of installation you can try /c/msys64 or /c/tools.
#    Alternatively, you can try the following command: `find /c -name "mingw64.exe" -print -quit 2>/dev/null`.
