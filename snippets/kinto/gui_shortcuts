# NOTE: For general GUIs, Kinto swaps 'Left Ctrl' and 'Left Alt' around on Chromebooks, so this needs to be accounted for in any 'General GUI' keyboard remaps.
# NOTE: Kinto also swaps the 'Right Alt' and 'Right Ctrl' keys around to reflect the, 'Spacebar -> Command -> Option', layout for UK Macs.

# Map 'Left Alt + 3' to 'Right Alt + 3' to produce the numbersign (#) symbol:
# NOTE: In a Mac layout, 'Option + 3' produces the numbersign. Since the option key is the second physical key left of the spacebbar, we will replicate the same.
